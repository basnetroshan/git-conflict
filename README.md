# fizzbuzz
Simply copy the code from fizzbuzz.html and paste it in text editor(i have used VS code), save it with .html and run it.
The program prompts the user for a number which is the upper limit.
Displays all the numbers except:
  if the number is divisible by 3, it displays 'fizz'
  While if the number is divisible by 5, it displays 'buzz'
  else if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it displays 'fizzbuzz'
  else it displays the number as it is.
It displays the number in a descending order to 1.
